    <p>Despite losing the all-time goals record to Ovechkin, Gretzky is still the all-time leader in both even strength and short handed goals. Ovechkin is the NHL's all-time leader in power play goals, a record he's held since 2022.</p>
    
    <p>The following is a line chart showing Ovechkin's career goals by season, demonstrating his longevity on the road to 895. His career high for goals in a single season occurred in 2007-08, a year where he scored 65.</p>
