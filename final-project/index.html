                            NEW YORK -- After Alex Ovechkin scored his NHL record-breaking 895th goal -- in vintage
                            Ovechkin fashion, from his "office," on an old-school wrist shot -- he skated to center ice
                            and belly flopped. <br /><br />The celebration, the Washington Capitals captain said, was
                            unplanned. <br /><br />"Ice was bad today," he explained. "I fell."

                            After the iconic moment, Ovechkin's teammates swarmed him. The late-season game between the
                            Capitals and New York Islanders paused for 25 minutes for an on-ice ceremony. Wayne Gretzky,
                            the legend whom Ovechkin passed, made his way down; the Hall of Famer graciously followed
                            the 39-year-old from one arena to the next as he closed in on his record, fulfilling a
                            promise to be the first person to shake Ovechkin's hand afterward -- just as Gordie Howe,
                            the previous record holder, had done for Gretzky in 1994.

                            As the league set up carpet on the ice, Ovechkin was focused on hugging each of his
                            teammates. Ovechkin then fixated on finding his family, including his mother, wife and their
                            two young sons.
