                        NEW YORK &mdash; After Alex Ovechkin scored his NHL record-breaking 895th goal -- in vintage
                        Ovechkin fashion, from his "office," on an old-school wrist shot -- he skated to center ice and
                        belly flopped. <br /><br />The celebration, the Washington Capitals captain said, was unplanned.
                        <br /><br />"Ice was bad today," he explained. "I fell."

                    <p>
                        After the iconic moment, Ovechkin's teammates swarmed him. The late-season game between the
                        Capitals and New York Islanders paused for 25 minutes for an on-ice ceremony. Wayne Gretzky, the
                        legend whom Ovechkin passed, made his way down; the Hall of Famer graciously followed the
                        39-year-old from one arena to the next as he closed in on his record, fulfilling a promise to be
                        the first person to shake Ovechkin's hand afterward -- just as Gordie Howe, the previous record
                        holder, had done for Gretzky in 1994.

                        As the league set up carpet on the ice, Ovechkin was focused on hugging each of his teammates.
                        Ovechkin then fixated on finding his family, including his mother, wife and their two young
                        sons.

                        All the while, a video tribute played on the videoboard at UBS Arena on Long Island.<br /><br />Those
                        congratulating Ovechkin included a who's who of sports GOATs: Roger Federer, Michael Jordan,
                        LeBron James, Sidney Crosby, Derek Jeter, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky.

                    <p>
                        "To be honest with you, I didn't see it," Ovechkin said. "But the boys told me that lots of
                        great people, great athletes support me and congratulate me. It's huge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As teammate Tom Wilson said earlier in the week, the attention on Ovechkin was unparalleled for
                        their sport. "To try to think about what he's going through, the pressure, the entire game of
                        hockey is on his shoulders right now. It's bigger than hockey," Wilson said. "And for him to
                        handle that, to perform, to lead the top team in the league and still be such a fun teammate,
                        it's really remarkable."<br /><br />It's what makes Ovechkin, the NHL's new all-time leader in
                        goals, a true original -- and perhaps the last man who will ever hold the title.

                    <p>
                        WHEN GRETZKY ECLIPSED Howe's mark 31 years ago, many around the sport believed that was it.
                        Nobody would surpass The Great One, whose stat line was so outlandish over a 1,487-game career,
                        that you could take away his final goal total (894) and he'd still be the league's all-time
                        leader in points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gretzky, over the years, was known to say he was sure "somebody, somewhere will come along and
                        break it." But few people believed it, especially as the game evolved. The average goals per NHL
                        game during Gretzky's career was 6.93. Since Ovechkin's rookie season, the average is 5.72. But
                        something was always different about Ovechkin, who was a surefire talent when the Capitals
                        selected him No. 1 in 2004. Ovechkin scored two goals in his first NHL game and finished with 52
                        in his rookie season.

                    <p>
                        The "Alex Ovechkin Effect" in Washington, D.C., is undeniable. Since Ovechkin's rookie season
                        (2005-06), hockey players in the Potomac Valley region have increased by 71%, according to USA
                        Hockey statistics. To help meet the growing demand for access, the Caps have helped build or
                        refurbish 14 outdoor inline rinks. Ovechkin used his platform for charity; in March he pledged a
                        dollar amount equal to his career goal total to pediatric cancer for every goal he scored for
                        the rest of his career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His reach expands well past Caps fandom. Utah Hockey Club center Logan Cooley, who was born in
                        Pittsburgh a year before Crosby's and Ovechkin's debut seasons, cites Ovechkin as his favorite
                        player growing up. Canadiens winger Patrik Laine grew up in Finland idolizing the Russian
                        winger. Even Minnesota Wild defenseman Brock Faber admits he owned Ovechkin jerseys growing up.

                        OVECHKIN WAS OFF to a torrid start this season, in which the Capitals surprisingly emerged as
                        the top team in the league after successfully undergoing a retool on the fly. He scored 15 goals
                        through his first 18 games before things came to a screeching halt just before Thanksgiving. The
                        Capitals' captain had already scored twice against Utah in a Nov. 18 road game when Utah's Jack
                        McBain cut through Washington's zone and got tangled with Ovechkin, who immediately fell to the
                        ice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result: a broken left fibula. It was the first time in Ovechkin's 20-year career that he
                        broke a bone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "When that happened," goaltender Charlie Lindgren said, "everyone was kind of thinking to
                        themselves whether or not it was going to be possible."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Ovechkin is built differently. As he famously declared after avoiding injury from an errant
                        puck in 2006:
                    </p>

                    <p class="pull-quote">"I'm OK, Russian machine never breaks."</p>
                    <p class="pq-att">- Alex Ovechkin</p>
                    <p>
                        Within two days of the injury, Ovechkin rid himself of the walking boot. (The fibula doesn't
                        take on a substantial weight-bearing load.) Soon after, he was skating. Ovechkin remained around
                        the team, getting electric stimulation to help with blood flow, and just had to wait it out
                        until the bone healed enough to sustain contact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ovechkin returned just after Christmas, scoring in each of his first two games back, naturally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ovechkin's unorthodox habits -- in an age when many elite athletes view their body as a temple
                        -- have become legendary. Before arriving at the team plane for a road trip, Ovechkin always
                        stops at the same Subway where he orders a spicy Italian footlong and Flaming Hot Cheetos. When
                        the Capitals arrive at road arenas, there's a request that the No. 8 water bottles on the bench
                        be filled with Coke or Pepsi, whichever the arena has a deal with. His home pregame meal is a
                        heavy one: a chicken parm and pasta Alfredo combination from a local joint, Mamma Lucia's.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ovechkin won't be the first or last player in the gym, and he's judicious about how much time he
                        spends on the ice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "At this point in his career, he knows exactly what he needs to do to get himself ready," said
                        his locker mate, Nic Dowd, who explained the two keep opposite hours. "A lot of it is mental.
                        And it's hard to argue against the results."

                    <p>
                        ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS the NHL has been keenly aware of Ovechkin's chase for Gretzky's record. What
                        many fans don't know: the details that allow Ovechkin to thrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He's a gear nerd. It's not a secret that Ovechkin is an equipment free agent right now. Most
                        players have deals with CCM, Bauer, Sherwood or True hockey. Last season, Ovechkin toyed with a
                        few different sticks until he found a custom model around All-Star Weekend. Since switching to
                        the new stick -- which is wrapped in black, with no logos -- Ovechkin has scored 64 goals in 96
                        games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Capitals coach Spencer Carbery has made an intentional effort to put Ovechkin in better
                        positions to thrive. Ovechkin's ice time was reduced to under 18 minutes per game this season
                        for the first time in his career. He cut his 4-on-4 play, has sometimes swapped him from left to
                        right wing, and gives him more shifts in the offensive zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "It's about quality shifts, not quantity," Carbery said. "And with O, if you present him the
                        information, if you explain here's why we're doing this and here's how it will help you and the
                        team, he always buys in. That's never an issue."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The one nonnegotiable: Ovechkin isn't missing any ice time during the two minutes the Caps are
                        on the power play. Ovechkin has been on the ice for 97.3% of the Caps' power-play time this
                        season. Only four other players are in the 80% range or higher: Nikita Kucherov, Nathan
                        MacKinnon, Leon Draisaitl and Quinn Hughes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ovechkin is not resented in the locker room because he is emphatic about being a good teammate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "It really feels like he gets more excited, or just as excited for our goals than his goals,"
                        said Dylan Strome, who assisted on No. 895. "He's always keeping the mood light, with all of his
                        pregame routines, handshakes with guys in the tunnel, screaming in the locker room. He's very

                        When rookie Aliaksei Protas was first called up, he needed to return to the farm club in
                        Hershey, Pennsylvania, to retrieve some personal items on an off day. And he needed to borrow
                        one of his teammates' cars.

                    <p>
                        "The big man come up to me, and first he is mad because I asked [Evgeny Kuznetsov], and he said,
                        'Why didn't [you] come to me straight?'" Protas recalled.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ovechkin loaned Protas his car. "He told me to keep it for a few months," Protas said.</p>

                        Washington signed its top prospect, Ryan Leonard, on March 31, the day before the Caps played in
                        Boston. Ovechkin texted Leonard, the Boston College star who was already in town, and invited
                        him to a sushi dinner that night with a few teammates. Afterward, Leonard told Ovechkin a few of
                        his buddies would love to meet him, and they knew just the spot. So the night before Ovechkin
                        scored No. 891, he was drinking a beer at Circle Tavern, a bar near the BC campus.

                        "Everywhere we go lately, it's been rock-star stuff the second he walks into a room, people grab
                        their phones," Wilson said. "And he doesn't get fazed by it at all. He'll go out walking in a
                        Canadian city, doesn't care who recognizes him. Will stop for fans. Most guys aren't like that.
                        But that's just Ovi."

                        ON THE DAY Ovechkin tied Gretzky's record, there was an aura surrounding him. He was smiling and
                        laughing as he came off the ice. He was most excited to see his former Stanley Cup-winning
                        teammates, such as Nicklas Backstrom, T.J. Oshie and Braden Holtby, who were being honored later
                        that night as part of the Capitals' 50th anniversary celebration.

                    <p>
                        Backstrom and Ovechkin have always been instinctively linked, with the Swedish center assisting
                        on more of his goals (279) than any other player. Backstrom (hip) and Oshie (back) have not had
                        the same injury luck as Ovechkin. Both are still under contract but sidelined on long-term
                        injured reserve, probably for the remainder of their careers. Ovechkin acknowledged both players
                        in his on-ice speech.

                    <p>
                        "There's not many instances where someone has openly, in one instance or another, kind of
                        thanked me in front of the world," Oshie said. "So in that moment, I kind of assumed and knew
                        that 'Backy' was going to get a shoutout. They go hand in hand and their bond is like no other
                        of two teammates that I've seen. But for him to call my name in that moment was incredibly
                        special and, honestly, very emotional for me inside to have him mention and give me a little
                        shoutout during the biggest accomplishment that the world of hockey has seen in a very long
                        time."

                    <p>
                        Now, everyone wonders whether there could be another moment like this. As for Ovechkin's
                        personal goals, he has been very coy. Though he once famously told ESPN's Linda Cohn he'd retire
                        as soon as he broke Gretzky's record, that's not a foregone conclusion. Ovechkin is under
                        contract for one more season for $9.5 million. He'd love to win another Stanley Cup, and this
                        Washington team has proved capable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next question is: Will anyone come for Ovi's record? Should Ovechkin play next season then
                        retire, ESPN Research projects he will finish with 937 career goals. At his current goals pace
                        (0.64 per game), it would take Matthews 848 games to surpass it; that puts him 11 seasons away.
                        For Draisaitl (0.51), the projection is 1,066 games (13 seasons). David Pastrnak (0.52) and
                        Connor McDavid (0.51) are each projected to get there in 14 seasons.

                    <p>
                        Perhaps, they -- or someone else -- will get there one day. But for the foreseeable future, that
                        record belongs to Ovechkin.

                        "This is something crazy. I'm probably going to need a couple more days. Maybe a couple weeks to
                        realize what it means to be No. 1," Ovechkin said Sunday. "All I can say, I'm very proud. I'm
                        very proud for myself. I'm really proud for my family, for all my teammates, that helped me to
                        reach that milestone, and for all my coaches. It's huge. It's an unbelievable moment."
